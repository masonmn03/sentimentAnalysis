C++ Sentiment Analysis Program

Developed a C++ program that processes a paragraph of text and evaluates the sentiment of each word. The program assigns a numerical sentiment value to each word, with positive words mapped to positive scores and negative words to negative scores. By iterating through the input, it generates a sentiment profile of the paragraph, demonstrating skills in string parsing, data structures, and algorithm design.
